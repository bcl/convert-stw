    IMPORTANT! Our records show that you do not have a license to operate this software. Normally, you would be required to complete a License Application Form and mail it(with proof of purchase) to our Licensing Department, and then wait the customary four to six months for processing. Luckily, for your convenience, we have, at the last minute and at great expense, installed a remarkable new on-line electronic application form on this very disk, which will be processed by our modern 24-hour computer service moments after you fill it in.
    Thus begins another great Infocom epic. The zany author, Douglas Adams, from Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy fame has teamed up with infocom for yet another great adventure. This time you have just gotten a letter from your new boss at Happitec welcoming you to the company, and informing you that you are being sent on an all expense paid two-week trip to Paris for training. They are even throwing in $75 spending money. Sounds great right?!
    Well, there are several catches. You have just moved into your new home, and the bank has stubbornly refused to pay attention to the Change of Address Form you filled out. All of you mail is being sent to your old home, where the new owner, who just happens to hate you, has sent it back to the bank to let them sort it out. You credit card has been invalidated, and a new one sent to your old address.
    You quest is to try and get to Paris, while squirming your way around the Bureaucracy that is out to get you. No easy task since the every one tries to block your way in one way or the other. During your travels you must also watch your blood pressure. If it gets up too high you can die suddenly. To keep your blood pressure down, you must avoid anything that could upset you, and if it does start to rise too high, just wait for a couple of rounds. It will eventually return to normal.
    The game package comes with a flyer for Popular Paranoia magazine, an application form for a Fillmore Better Beezer Card, and a extremely small pencil. Kind of like the ones the bureaucrats use.
    This program is copy protected like most of the other Infocom Interactive Fiction series, you MUST have the pieces included in the game package to get past part of the game. This is absolutely the best way of copy protection that I have run across. It allows you to make backup copies for yourself without waiting several weeks to months for the company to send you another, or buying some exotic, and expensive,  copy program which might not even copy the program anyway. This game, as with all of the other Infocom games is easy to understand and communicate with, using full english sentences.
    The story behind Bureaucracy is true. Douglas Adams, the author, moved to a new apartment in London. He notified everyone he should, and was generally very happy with his new home. Then, one day, he tried to use a credit card but couldn't. For weeks, he tried to get the bank to acknowledge his change-of-address form. He talked to many bank officials, and filled out new forms, and tried to get a new credit card issued, but nothing worked. e had no credit, and the bank behaved like, well, a bank. The bank finally sent him a letter, apologizing for the inconvenience - but they sent it to his old address.
    This game is one of the best Infocom games that I have ever played. It is funny, tough, and most important of all, you don't get bored. The game is rated Interactive Fiction Plus, and in some places it is defiantly tough.
